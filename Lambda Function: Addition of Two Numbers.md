# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
f = lambda a, b: a+b
print(f(x,y))
```

## Output:

## Result:
Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum is successfully executed.
